# Python Ping Pong Game

## Description

The Python Ping Pong Game is an engaging GUI game built using the Turtle library. This game incorporates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to organize and manage different components, including the score, paddle, and ball. The player controls the paddle to hit the ball, earning points for successful hits.

## Features

- **GUI Game**: Utilizes the Turtle library for creating an interactive graphical user interface.

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Implements OOP concepts for a modular and organized code structure.

- **Score System**: Keeps track of the player's score, updating it with each successful hit.

- **Paddle Control**: Allows the player to control the paddle using keyboard inputs.

- **Ball Movement**: Implements realistic ball movement and collision detection for an engaging gaming experience.

## How it Works

1. **Paddle, Ball, and Score Objects**: The game consists of three main objects - Paddle, Ball, and Score - each implemented using OOP.

2. **Game Loop**: The main game file contains a loop that continuously updates the game state, including the positions of the paddle and ball.

3. **User Interaction**: The player controls the paddle using keyboard inputs to hit the ball.

4. **Scoring**: The Score object keeps track of successful hits, updating the player's score.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ping-pong-game.git
    cd ping-pong-game
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

    The game relies on the Turtle library, which is usually included in Python installations by default.

3. **Run the Game**:

    ```bash
    python ping_pong_game.py
    ```

4. **Game Controls**:

    - Use the up and down arrow keys to control the paddle.
    - Enjoy playing and earn points by hitting the ball!

## Code Structure

The code is organized into three main classes:

- **Paddle**: Represents the player-controlled paddle.
- **Ball**: Represents the game ball with realistic movement.
- **Score**: Manages the player's score.

The main file (`ping_pong_game.py`) brings these classes together to create the complete Ping Pong game.
